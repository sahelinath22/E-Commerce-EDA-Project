# 📊 E-Commerce Data Analysis (EDA) — Python Project


This repository contains an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project performed on an E-Commerce Superstore Dataset using Python in Jupyter Notebook.

The goal of this analysis is to uncover meaningful insights about sales performance, customer behavior, profitability, product efficiency, and regional contribution to support business decision-making.

🎯 **Project Objectives**

This project aims to answer key business questions, including:

1. Which regions, states, and cities drive maximum sales and profit?

2. Which categories and sub-categories generate the most revenue?

3. Which products or regions are causing losses and need strategic attention?

4. How do sales and profit trends vary across months and years?

5. What is the role of customer segments, shipping modes, and order priorities?

6. How can profitability be improved through pricing, discounting, and supply chain optimization?

🧰 **Tools & Technologies Used**

👉🏻Python

👉🏻Jupyter Notebook

👉🏻pandas, numpy

👉🏻matplotlib, seaborn

👉🏻plotly (for interactive charts)

👉🏻Superstore Dataset (CSV)

📂 **Dataset Overview**

The dataset contains:

1. Order Details: Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode

2. Customer Details: Customer Name, Segment

3. Product Details: Category, Sub-Category, Product Name

4. Geographical Data: Country, City, State, Region

5. Business Metrics: Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit

📌 **New Features Created**

a. Order Year

b. Order Month

c. Sales-to-Profit Ratio (for margin analysis)

🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

📅 **1. Monthly & Yearly Trends**

Identified peak months for sales and profit.

Analyzed year-over-year growth in revenue.

Detected months with high sales but low profit due to heavy discounting.

🌍 **2. Regional, State & City Performance**

**A) Region-Level Insights**

West & East regions contributed the highest revenue.

Highlighted underperforming regions needing strategic focus.

**B) State-Level Insights**

Top states: California, Washington, New York.

Some high-revenue states showed negative profit, indicating operational inefficiencies.

**C) City-Level Insights**

Identified top-performing cities and cities with consistent losses.

📦 **3. Category & Sub-Category Performance**

Categories: Technology, Office Supplies, Furniture

Technology generated the highest revenue.

Sub-categories like Phones, Chairs, Binders led in sales.

❗ **Key finding:**

Tables showed consistent negative profit despite high sales — a critical pricing or cost issue.

👥 **4. Customer Segment Analysis**

Segments: Consumer, Corporate, Home Office

Consumer segment generated the highest sales.

Corporate buyers provided stable profit margins.

🚚 **5. Ship Mode & Order Priority Analysis**

Standard Class was the most frequently used ship mode.

Faster ship modes improved customer experience but increased cost.

Order priority did not strongly impact profitability.

📈 **6. Sales-to-Profit Ratio**

Identified high-volume but low-margin sub-categories.

Helped in spotting products requiring pricing or cost adjustments.

🧾 **Key Business Insights**

A) Best performing category: Technology

B) Most profitable sub-categories: Phones, Accessories

C) Worst performing sub-category: Tables (negative profit)

D) Top-performing regions: West, East

E) High-revenue states: California, Washington, New York

F) Growth pattern:

Sales increased year-over-year

Profit fluctuated due to discount policies and rising costs

G) Customer insights:

Consumer segment contributes highest revenue

📌 **Conclusion**

This E-Commerce EDA project successfully uncovers:

✅Regional and product-level performance patterns

✅Customer behavior insights

✅Profitability gaps

✅Opportunities to improve pricing, supply chain, and marketing

The project demonstrates strong analytical and visualization skills using Python, making it useful for stakeholders in the business and data analytics domain.
